Important changes in the Autotoolized packaging of Lua 5.1.5

5.1.5.02	2015-03-17T15:07:25-0400

  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    * luaconf.h no longer uses lib64 as the directory for 64bit
      platforms.  This worked on only a subset of operating systems.
      The user must now explicitly set the library directory.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

    * --enabled-versioned-install configure option.  library and
      pkg-config files may now have versions incorporated into their
      names. See README.autotool for more information.

  [BUG FIXES]

    * lua.pc uses configure generated paths for INSTALL_LMOD and INSTALL_CMOD,
      rather than assuming their location relative to $prefix

  [INFRASTRUCTURE]

    * replaced hardcoded values with configure derived values where possible
    * provided separate packaging and Lua versions.


5.1.5.01	2015-03-17T10:36:58-0400

  * initial tagged release
